# About Me
&nbsp;

Over the last year I have been working closely with Generation, a learning organisation who have supported me in my journey into tech, particularly focusing on the Cloud. In late 2020, I underwent a 3-month intensive programme in Cloud Operations, which built on my knowledge of Python, Networking, and Linux, and gave me a strong understanding of core AWS services, such as EC2, ECS, IAM, Cloud Formation, and S3. The course simulated an actual IT job role in many ways, and was largely lab driven, and self taught, with lectures to explain the thoery being delivered at the beginning of each new topic. We made constant use of Slack and Trello to organise our own workloads and help each other with the labs sessions. Following this programme, I continued my learning, becoming more familiar with the AWS CLI and AWS Lambda, and also completed the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam.

Generation have provided me with a good foundation to further develop in key areas of DevOps and Cloud Operations. I have since completed the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam, the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification, and am now working towards the Developer Associate exam. Over the next few years, I would like to continue my studies of Python and the Cloud, learning how to develop solutions, and work more with IaC. I am also eager to build on my knowledge of Containerization and Linux, and gain more experience with CI/CD, Git and Scrum.
