# About Me
&nbsp;

Over the last year I have been working closely with Generation, a learning organisation who have supported me in my journey into tech, particularly focusing on the Cloud. In late 2020, I underwent a 3-month intensive programme in Cloud Operations, which built on my knowledge of Python, Networking, and Linux, and gave me a strong understanding of core AWS services, such as EC2, ECS, IAM, Cloud Formation, and S3. The course simulated an actual IT job role in many ways, and was largely lab driven, and self taught, with lectures to explain the thoery being delivered at the beginning of each new topic. We made constant use of Slack and Trello to organise our own workloads and help each other with the labs sessions. Following this programme, I continued my learning, becoming more familiar with the AWS CLI and AWS Lambda, and also completed the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam.

Generation have provided me with a good foundation to further develop in key areas of DevOps and Cloud Operations. I have since completed the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam, the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification, and am now working towards the Developer Associate exam. Over the next few years, I would like to continue my studies of Python and the Cloud, learning how to develop solutions, and work more with IaC. I am also eager to build on my knowledge of Containerization and Linux, and gain more experience with CI/CD, Git and Scrum.

# Projects

&nbsp;
## [Terraform script to build VPC and EC2 instance](https://kasimakhtar.github.io/kasimakhtar/simple-terraform.html)
This terraform script creates a basic cloud architecture, including a VPC, Subnet, Internet Gateway, and EC2 Instance. When executed, you can SSH into the Linux instance, provided you have a valid key pair.
&nbsp;
## [Lambda function for word count](https://kasimakhtar.github.io/kasimakhtar/lambda-function.html)
This mini project uses multiple AWS services together in order to send a text message to notify about a new upload to S3. In this example, the message sent includes the word count of text files.
&nbsp;
## [Bash script to automatically create 25 new files in a folder](https://kasimakhtar.github.io/kasimakhtar/file_creator.html)
This bash script is written for a directory that is reserved for a specific set of files, all with the same names, but with each new file ending in an increasing number to uniquely identify them. The script creates additional files, each with a unique number.
&nbsp;
## [Various Python Code](https://kasimakhtar.github.io/kasimakhtar/python-series.html)
This post includes some Python CodeWar challenges that I found interesting, and was able to use elsewhere. CodeWars has been a really useful way for me to grow in my knowledge of Python, in a fun and challenging way.
&nbsp;
## [Workflow to build static site from gh-pages branch](https://kasimakhtar.github.io/kasimakhtar/CI-CD-workflow.html)
This GitHub workflow is an example of CI/CD. It pushes content from the master branch to the gh-pages branch, which the static website is being built from.
